- 👋 Hi, I’m Cieran.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning all sorts of new programming languages and expanding my toolset as much as possible!
- 🌱 I’m currently working on my Software Engineering Capstone Project; Physio Companion. A physiotherapy companion app utilizing computer vision to connect at-home patients and physiotherapists for constant check-ins and progress updates.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate and work on team-wide progress with my capstone teammates.
- 📫 How to reach me, you can go through my git or email me at cdiebolt@abtronautomation.com.
